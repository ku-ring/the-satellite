# Usage

To use the Satellite in your project, add the following import statement at the top of your file:

```swift
import Satellite
```

## v1: Sputnik

"Version **Sputnik**" is the very first version of **the Satellite**, providing very basic public interfaces for API communication in Swift. It offers two main interfaces, one for *Swift concurrency* and another for *Combine*. Let's see how to use them.

### 1. Creating the new Satellite instance with your host domain
```swift
let satellite = Satellite(
    host: "{BASE.URL}",
    scheme: .http // default: `.https`
)
```

### 2. Declare Request and Response
```swift
// Expected response object
struct CatFact: Codable {
    let text: String
}
```

### 3-a. Sending the request and receiving the response (Combine/Publisher)
```swift
let satellite = Satellite(host: "cat-fact.herokuapp.com")
cancellable  = statellite
    .responsePublisher<ResponseType: [CatFact]>(
        for: "facts/random",
        httpMethod: .get,
        queryItems: [
            URLQueryItem(name: "animal_type", value: "cat"),
            URLQueryItem(name: "amount", value: "2")
        ]
    )
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { print ("Received completion: \($0).") },
        receiveValue: { catFacts in print("Cat Facts: \(catFacts).")}
    )
```

### 3-b. Sending the request and waiting the response (Async await)
```swift
let satellite = Satellite(host: "cat-fact.herokuapp.com")
let catFacts: [CatFact] = try await satellite.response(
    for: "facts/random",
    httpMethod: .get,
    queryItems: [
        URLQueryItem(name: "animal_type", value: "cat"),
        URLQueryItem(name: "amount", value: "2")
    ]
)
self.text = catFacts
    .compactMap { $0.text }
    .joined(separator: ", ")
```
